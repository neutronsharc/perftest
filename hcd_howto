This project is derived from "linux-rdma/perftest", with a custom patch from HCD to print "send_bw" and "send_latency"
every 1 second during running.

Right now only "ib_send_bw" and "ib_send_lat" are supported.

Usage example of "ib_send_bw": RC send bandwidth, data size=5000 bytes, tx-queue=4, duration = 10 seconds, use RDMA-cm
to establish conn, measure bi-direction bandwidth.

- server:
$./ib_send_bw -F -s 5000 -t 4 -D 10 -R -b

-client:
$./ib_send_bw -F -s 5000 -t 4 -D 10 -R -b <srv ip>


Usage example of "ib_send_lat": RC send latency, data size=500 bytes, tx-queue=4, duration = 10 seconds

- server side:
$./ib_send_lat -F -s 500 -t 4 -D 10

- client:
$./ib_send_lat -F -t 4 -s 500 -D 10 <srv ip>
